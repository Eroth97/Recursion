# Recursion
These are two recursion exercises, suggested at TOP's JS path. The idea is to implement the Fibonacci sequence and the Merge Sort algorithm, using recursive functions. The fibonacci code also includes a non recursive version. 

# How to test?

You can download the JS files into your computer and run them using node. For this you must type `node [path-to-file]` into your terminal. Following the suggestions of a couple of friends, you can find the expected result commented into the actual code. 

If you have any suggestions or doubts, please share them!
